# 📌 Machine Learning Assignment - Group 11

## 📖 Overview
This project explores three fundamental concepts in **Mathematics for Machine Learning**:
1. **Exponential Distribution** 📊 - Modeling the time between random events.
2. **Bayesian Probability** 🤔 - Updating beliefs based on new evidence.
3. **Gradient Descent** 📉 - Optimizing a model to best fit data.

The implementation is done using **Python**, with **NumPy, Matplotlib, and SciPy** for numerical computations and visualizations.

## 🏗️ Installation and Setup
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1️⃣ Install Python (if not already installed)
Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
cd Machine_Learning_Assignment
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Open `Probability_Distributions_group11.ipynb` and run the code cells.

## 📝 Features and Implementation
### **1️⃣ Exponential Distribution**
- Models time between customer arrivals at a coffee shop.
- Uses **NumPy** to generate random wait times.
- Visualized using **Matplotlib**.

### **2️⃣ Bayesian Probability**
- Simulates medical diagnosis (probability of having a disease given a positive test result).
- Implements **Bayes' Theorem** step by step.

### **3️⃣ Gradient Descent for Linear Regression**
- Predicts exam scores based on hours studied.
- Uses **Scipy’s minimize()** function for optimization.
- Plots the best-fit line using **Matplotlib**.

## 📊 Example Output
After running the notebook, you will see:
- **A histogram** of Exponential Distribution.
- **Probability calculations** using Bayes’ Theorem.
- **A visualization** of Gradient Descent optimizing a linear model.
